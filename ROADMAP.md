- # Feature Roadmap
- ## v1.0 
  These are features that are critical to the eventual 1.0 release:  
	- ## 0.2.0
		- **Proper PDF Element Parsing**
			- This is necessary and mandatory for being able to automatically assign scene numbers to shotlines
		- **Quality of Life / Workflow Efficiency**
			- Auto-populate ShotLine fields with relevant metadata
				- Automatic nominal scene number detection
				- Automatically assign next shot number in sequence when creating multiple shotlines
	- ## 0.3.0
		- Right click menu on shotline with option "Duplicate inverted" for instantly creating a shotline with the opposite filmed / unfilmed segments
			- Change (segment film toggle) from right-click to ctrl click
			-
		- **User Input**
			- Abstract user input using Godot input mapping, prepare for touch-screen based input
			- Intuitive Touchscreen Controls (i.e. for Android or iOS, but could also include Windows or Linux tablet support)
			- Keyboard Shortcuts
				- Keyboard-focused controls for laptops
		- **UX / Workflow**
			-
			- Auto-populate shot TYPE (WIDE, MEDIUM, CLOSEUP, etc.) based a dropdown and/or radial menu that pops up after drawing each shotline
	- ## 0.4.0
		- **Exports**
			- Blank storyboard template
				- Each frame will correspond to a shotline, and will include metadata next to the frame like shot type, lens mm, setup #, etc.
				- Requires viewport and/or PDF export shenanigans which is haaaaard
	- ## 0.5.0
		- **Exports**
			- Filterable output based upon scenes or tags
				- For example, export a CSV with only certain categories of shots:
					- Only wide shots
					- Only particular setups or groups of setups
					- Only shots
				- Output multiple CSVs, per filter
				- Output custom shotlists from a custom shooting schedule
		- **UX**
			- Continuous Scroll-through pages view
			- Zoomable page view
			- UI Scaling
	- ## 0.6.0
		- **General Script Breakdown**
			- Document highlighting / Tagging
				- Generate reports on screenplay based upon occurrences of tagged elements like props, stunts, special effects, actors, etc.
			- User registered / searchable tags
				- i.e. User can create their own shotline-specific tags such as "Magnifying glass prop" or "Big car VFX" and then assign those tags to shotlines
				- Can recall and re-use existing user tags to new shotlines
				- Shotlines that cover highlighted page elements have those highlighted elements automatically added as page tags
				- Can search and filter based upon tags:
					- Shotlines
					- Pages
					- Scenes
				- "User-Tag-able" Items:
					- Scenes (Scene Headings)
					- Shotlines
	- ## 0.7.0
	- ## 0.9.0 (?)
	  This is major and critical, but the most complex problem, technically  
		- Screenplay Draft merge-forward
			- Ability to merge current shotlines onto a new draft of the screenplay
			- Because Shotliner stores each pageline with a unique UUID, it should be feasible to diff the current screenplay content with a newly imported draft.
			- Shotlines that are only on excised pages will be simply removed, but perhaps with a warning or "ghost" shotline to show what was lost
			- Some shotlines may be partially cut off, i.e. start on a deleted page but end on a page that is not excised.
				- these shotline fragments will be marked with a special color or outline or label, so the user can intervene manually
